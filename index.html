Please feel free to change the css (or anything really).  I did try to keep the css "dynamic" so when
you re-size the webpage everything isn't overlapping and thrown around

	 <div id="user">Username/login</div>
	 
	 <!--I've done login sessions before, but I used php as well as js.  Don't
	 know exactly how to replicate it yet in js but this is what the php looked like:
	 
	 Basically, at the top of each page was: 
	 <?php session_start(); ?>
	 And this kept a user logged in throughout all the webpages.  To log someone out you used:
	 session_destroy();
	 
	 And at the top of the page was either a "Login" option or a "Username" option.  The login
	 was displayed if you weren't logged in, and the username displayed the user's name if they
	 WERE logged in.  It also acted as a link to their profile.  This code checked which one to display:
     <?php if (!isset($_SESSION['user']) && empty($_SESSION['user'])) {?>
     <a href="login.php"> Login/Sign Up </a> <br>
     <?php  $_SESSION['employee'] = "false"; }else{ ?>
     <a href="profileDisplay.php"> Welcome, 
     <br> <?php echo $_SESSION['user']; ?> </a> <br> 
     </div>
	 Hopefully this helps us going forward...you guys might already know how to do this in js

	<div id="mainBar">
	
	<!--These are "dynamic" right now so we can add more and take away more without the formatting
	getting messed up - only change with width in css.  
	
	We can change the whole look of it...I figured most websites have a top
	bar but we can get rid of it if you guys have other suggestions!
	
	We'll need to make these buttons to re-direct the user to whatever new page each tab points to.
	I figure that's pretty easy and it might make more sense to just keep each page separate for now?
	Don't care too much either way :)
	
	Just noting that: window.location = "pagePath" can be called to change windows-->
