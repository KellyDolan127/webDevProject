Project:
   Title: Game Group
   Purpose: Gaming website


How to run:
   Our website relies on many API calls.  To see the data displayed on the webpage two things must be done:
  	1) In PuTTY 2 sessions need to be created in var/www/html and the sessions need to run "steam_news_api.js"
           and "steam_api_new.js"
        2) The browser being used must allow for requests from our server for the API calls. In Chrome the following
           add-on let us do this: Allow-Control-Allow-Origin
           https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-control-allow-origi/nlfbmbojpeacfghkpbjhddihlkkiljbi/related?hl=en-US
